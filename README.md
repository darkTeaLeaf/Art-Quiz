# Project description

**ArtQuizÂ®** is a Web-application for recognizing the pieces of art in a game manner.

There is a tremendous amount of paintings, tracks of art, and the user gets an opportunity to enrich knowledge about famous paintings of great masters of the brush by just using this service.

The centric element of a site is an unlimited carousel of paintings, additionally with several answer options containing the only correct one. The user may guess the name of the picture, the painter's name or the art movement.

Regardless the choice was successful or unsuccessful, the user will be provided with the correct answer and brief information about the piece of art the one was guessing about.

The user's account lets the one observe the progress and check some statistics, see the list of available and gained achievements. Also, the user can suggest the addition of  a new painting to  the system, which  is reviewed by  a site moderator.

As further development part, **Monetization through Gamification** add-on can be added to the service. It includes:

-   Art battles (guessing for a while);
-   Getting coins as a reward of accomplishing the achievements, competing in art battles and suggesting new paintings;
-   Thematic game modes (cost coins to unlock);
-   Top of best users;
-   Donation for coins and subscription unlocking all the content ðŸ’°.

# Project value

This project will be useful and valuable for people interested in art.
Regardless of the potential user is interested in art or just planning to broaden the horizons and enrich the knowledge of this theme, the application will be useful for both described types.

The service is:
* free;
* made of the game form;
* informative;
* encourages self-study and personal achievements.

# Goals

The main goal of completing this project is learning new technologies, practicing Agile in a real development process, creating something informative and useful - the product we would be happy to use by ourselves.

# Personal efforts

## Arina
In my humble opinion, the best way to learn something better is to practice. That's the main reason for this project - put into practice all concepts I've previously learned, and motivate myself to learn something new, the Django framework in my case. There's usually no time to spend on personal projects, and this is a great opportunity to create something that I dreamed about for a long time, as a part of the educational process, with supervisor and team.

## Irek

The frontend is my primary point of interest. I have experience in some frameworks, but React for now is the one I want to focus on. I plan to make it my main developing tool, on top of the others in my personal stack of technologies. Of course, there's no time to spend on practicing it during the semester, that's why I and Arina came up with the idea of ArtQuiz project - the field for our professional growth. Also, I'm interested in learning the art myself, so I'd be happy to use it.

* menu to choose the aspect of guessing.

MVP is planned to be done during the first iteration of the project development.
